# Project: Starship Blooper

*Starship Blooper* is a proof-of-concept game prototype that focuses on recreating the complex function of a starship in media such as *Star Trek*.

The project is currently being solo developed by myself, Nevermorr. I am recieving narrative and logistical guidance from Artemis.

## Programs Being Used

- **Game Engine:** [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (currently 4.3)
- **Worldbuilding:** [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## File Structure

There are currently three folders within the root of the git repo.

- **Godot_Project** - the actual project file for the game itself
- **Information_Reference** - some documents that can be referenced for data, i.e. how big planets are
- **SSB_Vault** - an Obsidian vault which contains information and brainstorming about the world of the game

## Current Goals

- Create a working prototype of the star chart that will be able to show a range of scale from the full galaxy to a single celestial body
- Create a database for the celestial bodies so they don't all have to be in the hierarchy at the same time
